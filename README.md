## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A ClickUp account with an API key

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed. We will use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run *clickup-mcp-server*.

```
uv --directory "/path/to/clickup-mcp-server" run clickup-mcp-server --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Or use a .env file (see Configuration section).

### Using PIP

Alternatively, you can install `clickup-mcp-server` via pip:

```
pip install clickup-mcp-server
```

After installation, you can run it as a script using:

```
python -m clickup_mcp_server --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Configuration

### API Key

You need a ClickUp API key to use this server. You can get one from [ClickUp API Settings](https://app.clickup.com/settings/apps).

The API key can be provided in two ways:

1. Command-line argument: `--api-key YOUR_API_KEY`
2. Environment variable in a `.env` file:
   ```
   CLICKUP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Usage with Claude Desktop

### Usage with VS Code

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others. 

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "clickup": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["clickup-mcp-server"],
        "env": {
          "CLICKUP_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Docker installation:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "clickup": {
        "command": "docker",

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Task Management with Claude

Claude can help you manage your ClickUp tasks:

1. **Creating a Task Plan**:
   Ask Claude to create a plan based on a specific task in ClickUp. Claude will:
   - Find the task by name or ID
   - Analyze its description and subtasks
   - Generate a structured plan for completing the task

2. **Task Automation**:
   For a task containing code-related instructions, Claude can:
   - Get the task details from ClickUp
   - Update the task status to "In Progress"
   - Implement the code according to the task requirements
   - Check off subtasks as they're completed
   - Update the status to "Ready for Review" when finished

3. **Task Reporting**:
   Ask Claude to generate summaries of tasks with specific statuses:
   - Get all tasks marked "In Progress"
   - Compile a status report with completion estimates
   - Create new tasks for blockers or dependencies

## Debugging

Run your server with the `-v` or `-vv` flag for increased verbosity:

```
uvx clickup-mcp-server -vv
```

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx clickup-mcp-server
```
